# Privacy Policy for Vitalité1

Last updated: 30th October 2024

Vitalité1 (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy. This policy outlines how we handle your personal information when you use the Vitalité1 app (the “App”). Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand how we handle your data.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

The Vitalité1 app does not collect any personal data or information directly from you. We do not gather, store, or process any of the following:

Personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
Sensitive data such as health-related information.
Location data.
Device information.
In short, no information is gathered by the App itself. You may use the app without worrying about the collection of any personal data while using the learning features provided by Vitalité1.

### 2. Login Information

To access the App’s content, users are required to log in. However, the App does not process or store login credentials directly. All user login information, including registration data, is managed on a separate server. This server is responsible for securely handling your account details and authenticating your access to the App.

When you log in to the App:

Your credentials are securely transmitted to the separate server for authentication.
The App only verifies your identity through the server and does not retain any login data.
We do not collect or store your password, username, or any other account-related information on the App.

### 3. External Servers

All personal data (such as usernames, emails, and any other registration data) is stored and managed securely on external servers that are not part of the Vitalité1 app itself. This information is subject to the privacy policy of the separate server or service provider where your data is registered.

The external server ensures that:

Your information is kept secure using industry-standard encryption methods.
Access to your data is limited to authorized personnel only.
Your data is used solely for authentication purposes and is not shared or sold to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
For more information on how your data is handled on these external servers, please refer to the privacy policy of the server provider you registered with.

### 4. Third-Party Services

The App itself does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising services, or social media platforms. As a result, there is no sharing of data from the App with third-party entities. All login activity is strictly handled between the App and the external authentication server.

### 5. Data Security

While the App itself does not store personal data, we work with trusted external servers to ensure your information is secure. These servers implement:

Encryption of data during transmission and storage.
Access controls to limit who can view or manage your data.
Regular security audits and updates to protect against unauthorized access or breaches.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we strive to use industry-standard security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data on external servers.

### 6. Your Data Rights

Since no personal data is collected or stored by the Vitalité1 app directly, the App itself does not handle requests for access, correction, or deletion of data. For such requests, you will need to contact the provider of the external server where your registration information is stored.

You have the right to:

Request access to the personal information stored on the external server.
Correct or update your information stored by the server.
Request the deletion of your account and personal data from the server, subject to the server’s data retention policy.
Please refer to the privacy policy of the external server for more details on how to exercise these rights.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make significant changes to this policy, we will notify you by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document.

We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.

By using the Vitalité1 app, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this privacy policy.
